## Overview
Welcome to the **Codemod Hub** ‚Äì your centralized repository for transformative code migration tools! This comprehensive collection of codemods simplifies framework and library upgrades, making software modernization more accessible and less error-prone.

## üåü What are Codemods?
Codemods are powerful automated code transformation scripts designed to:

- **Seamless Upgrades**: Effortlessly upgrade dependencies with minimal manual intervention
- **Version Migration**: Smoothly transition between major library versions
- **Code Standardization**: Enforce consistent code patterns across large and complex codebases
- **Efficiency Boost**: Dramatically reduce time-consuming manual refactoring efforts

## üöÄ Repository Purpose
While we encourage codemods to reside in their primary project repositories, this hub serves multiple critical functions:

- **Central Registry**: A comprehensive collection of orphaned or transitional codemods
- **Collaborative Platform**: A dynamic space for community-driven transformation scripts
- **Knowledge Showcase**: Highlight innovative and cutting-edge code migration techniques

## üì¶ Installation
To get started, ensure you have Node.js installed. You can run codemods using npx with multiple installation options:

```bash
# Global installation (optional, provides CLI access)
npm install -g @codemod/cli

# Direct npx execution (recommended for flexibility)
npx codemod <transform> --target <path> [...options]
```

## üîß Usage Guide
### Basic Command Syntax
```console
$ npx codemod <transform> --target <path> [...options]
```

### Command Parameters
| Parameter   | Description                                          | Default               |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| `transform` | Name of the specific transformation script           | *Required*           |
| `path`      | Target directory for code transformation            | Current directory    |
| `options`   | Additional configuration and customization parameters| *Optional*           |

### Practical Example
```bash
# Transform React components in the src directory
npx codemod react-upgrade --target ./src
```
